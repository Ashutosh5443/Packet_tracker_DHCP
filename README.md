# DHCP Implementation in Cisco Packet Tracer ðŸ–§  

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The setup includes a **router** configured as a DHCP server, **two switches** acting as gateways, and **six PCs** (three on each side) functioning as end nodes. The DHCP server dynamically assigns IP addresses to the PCs, eliminating the need for manual configuration and ensuring efficient network management.  

The network topology consists of **one router**, which provides IP addresses to client devices, **two switches** to facilitate connectivity, and **six PCs** that receive dynamically assigned IP addresses. This setup helps users understand how DHCP works in an enterprise-like network, ensuring smooth communication between devices.  

The project includes a **Packet Tracer (.pkt) file** with a pre-configured network. Additionally, a step-by-step guide is provided to help users configure the DHCP server, set up the switches, and verify network connectivity. The guide walks through configuring the router's DHCP pool, excluding static IPs, and enabling DHCP on end devices. Users can test the setup by checking assigned IP addresses and using the **ping** command to verify connectivity.  

To use this project, open **Cisco Packet Tracer**, load the provided `.pkt` file, and inspect the routerâ€™s DHCP configuration. Ensure that all PCs receive an IP address dynamically, and test network communication. This project is ideal for **CCNA students, networking enthusiasts, and professionals** looking to gain hands-on experience with DHCP in a simulated environment.  

This project is intended for **educational purposes** and can be modified or expanded based on user needs. Feel free to explore, experiment, and enhance your networking skills. ðŸš€
